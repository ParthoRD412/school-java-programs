Algorithm for spiral arrangement of matrix elements after being sorted

Algorithm for sorted_matrix() method
step 1 : take the matrix input and sort it in ascending order using bubble sorting technique

Algorithm for spiral() method
step 1 : take the matrix input and arrange it in a spiral form using loop and store it in a string and return the string

Algorithm for main() method
step 1 : take the number of rows and the columns of the square matrix input
step 2 : array declaration and initialization
step 3 : now taking the matrix elements as input
step 4 : print the original matrix and the the sorted and arranged matrix by invoking the spiral() method
