Algorithm from emrip number

step 1 : int n;

Algorithm for constructor Emrip()
ste 1 : initialize the value of n with nn which is the formal parameter

Algorithm for isPrime() method
step 1 : check whether the number is less than or equal to one if so return 0
step 2 : if the number is greater than 1 then run a for loop starting from 2 till the number - 1
setp 3 : if the number is divisible by any number other than 1 and the number itself then it is not a prime number then return 0
step 4 : if the condition of the if isn't satisfied then return 1 as it is a prime number

Algorithm for isEmrip() method
step 1 : check whether the number is prime or not by invokin gthe isPrime() method inside the if condition and display the messege accordingly
step 2 : In case it is a prime number then use while loop to reverse the number
step 3 : check whether the reverse of the number is also equal to the number if so then it is an Emrip number else not! and messege to be displayed accordingly

Algorithm for main() method
step 1 : Scanner class object creation
step 2 : take a number input
step 3 : pass the value of the number taken as input to the constructor while class object creation
step 4 : invoke the is isEmrip() method to get the output
