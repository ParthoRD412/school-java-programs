This is the algorithm for automorphic number using recursion

Algorithm for boolean isAutomorphic(int n, int s):
step 1 : Check if the original number is greater than 0 or not
step 2 : If yes then check if the last digit of both the original and square number are the same.
step 3 : If yes then remove those last digits and use recurtion to check if the next digits are same or not or if n has run out of digits which states that n is a automorphic number.
step 4 : But if the digits are not same then its not a automorphic number.
step 5 : Recursion runs till either it runs out of digits which returns true or gets two different digits which returns false.

Algorithm for main function:
step 1 : Take a number as input.
step 2 : Pass the number and square of it to isAutomorphic and check if it returns true or false.
step 3 : true means its an automorphic number and false means its not. Then the messages are displayed accordingly.
