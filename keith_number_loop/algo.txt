Algorithm for Keith number

Algorithm for main() method
step 1 : creating a scanner class object
step 2 : taking a number input
step 3 : maing a copy of the number
step 4 : convert the number to a string and store it inside some other variable
step 5 : to count the number of digits simply find the length of the string
step 6 : creation and declaration of an array arr[]
step 7 : run a for loop from the number-1 to 0 and extract the digits of the number and store them as array elements
step 8 : use a while loop which will run till the sum of digits is less than n
step 9 : shifting the array elements one digit forward and then last element will be the sum of the other digits
step 10 : check whether the number is equal to the sum and display the messege accourdingly
