Algorithm for palindrome string

Algorithm for boolean pali_word_check(String st):
step 1 : Reverse the inputed string.
step 2 : Check if the resersed string and the original are same are not if yes then return true and else false.

Algorithm for String pali_to_nonpali(String st):
step 1 : Convert the palindrome word to non palindrome word by adding a character which as per the ASCII is the next charater to the last character of the word.

Algorithm for main function:
step 1 : Take a string as input.
step 2 : Make a string SDA of words by spliting the input string by " ".
step 3 : Go through all the words.
step 4 : Check if a word is palindrome or not.
step 5 : If yes then convert the palindrome word to a non palindrome word and print it.
