Algorithm for vowel consonant

Algorithm for boolean startsWithVowel(String st):
step 1 : Check if the first character of st is a vowel or not.
step 2 : Return the answere in true or false.

Algorithm for boolean endsWithConsonant(String st):
step 1 : Check if the last character of st is a consonant or not.
step 2 : Return the answere in true or false.

Algorithm for main function:
step 1 : Take a string as an input.
step 2 : Make a string SDA to store the words and fill it by spliting the string by " ".
step 3 : Make a counter variable to store the number of words that satisfied the condition.
step 4 : Go through all the words.
step 5 : Check if a word starts with a vowel and ends with a consonant or not.
step 6 : If yes then the word is printed and the counter variable is incremented.
step 7 : After the loop check if there were no word that satisfied the condition that is if counter is 0.
step 8 : Then print No words in the sentence begin with vowel and end with consonant
